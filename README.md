#### ROS:
- [Officoal documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/StartGuide)

- [Official git](https://github.com/ros)

- [Official wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/StartGuide)

- Coutse, learning materials: [Intro to the robot operating system](https://robohub.org/ros-101-intro-to-the-robot-operating-system/)  
Weâ€™ll answer questions like where do I begin? How do I get started? What terminology should I brush up on? Keep an eye out for this ongoing ROS 101 blog series that will provide you with a top to bottom view of ROS that will focus on introducing basic concepts simply, cleanly and at a reasonable pace. This guide is meant as a groundwork for new users, which can then be used to jump into in-depth data at wiki.ros.org. If you are totally unfamiliar with ROS, Linux, or both, this is the place for you!

#### ML/Deep learning:

- Course, learning materials: [Course fastAI](http://course.fast.ai/)  
You'll learn how to use deep learning to solve your problems in week 1, but will only start to learn why it works in week 2! And you'll spend a lot more time learning how to write effective code and use effective processes than you will on learning mathematical formalisms.

- Book: [Deep learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)  
The Deep Learning textbook is a resource intended to help students and practitioners enter the field of machine learning in general and deep learning in particular. The online version of the book is now complete and will remain available online for free. Full book as a single [PDF](https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf/blob/master/complete-book-pdf/deeplearningbook.pdf)

- Book: [Understanding machine learning theory algorithms](https://github.com/ec2ainun/books-ML-and-DL/blob/master/understanding-machine-learning-theory-algorithms%20BY%20Shai%20Shalev-Shwartz%20and%20Shai%20Ben-David.pdf)  
The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides a theoretical account of the fundamentals underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics, the book covers a wide array of central topics unaddressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for advanced undergraduates or beginning graduates, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics and engineering.

#### Online courses/videos

- [Understanding SVM (Support Vector Machine) Algorithms](https://www.techgig.com/webinar/Understanding-SVM-Support-Vector-Machine-Algorithms-1083)  
Support vector machines which are which are popularly called SVM received lot of importance of late due to their wide used in machine learning. They are capable of solving Complex classification problems by adjusting the decision boundaries an optimal way. As far as the performance is concerned their performance is superior compared to other machine learning techniques such as decision tree, logistic regression and multivariate regression. The webinar focuses on important characteristics of SVM and it is illustrated in their few case studies.
